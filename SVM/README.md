# Support Vector Machines

The class SVM uses LIBSVM , a very known library, to build its classifier. Its has few extra methods to visualize the input data. This visualization helps to improve your Classifier by fine tuning the SVM's paramenters. Moreover, SVM accepts input data in form of numpy arrays as well as lists, tuple or dictionaries. 

Usage is clearly illustrated in the two examples, one for linear and other for non-linear classifier. 

The dataset is taken from Andrew NG's Coursera course on Machine learning.
