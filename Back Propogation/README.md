# 3 Layered Neural-Network

## Features:
1.	Can implement a 3 layered (only 1 hidden layer) neural network.
2.	Has a built in function to split a dataset into training, cross-validation and test dataset.
3.	Uses 'CG' (conjugate gradient algorithm) as an optimization algorithm. (LBFGS-B will be added soon)
4.  Uses 'logistic' activation function.
5.  Uses Back Propogation alorithm.

## Drawbacks:
1. Lot slower than Scipy's MLPClassifier.
